# City Trees

This is the source for the City Trees app, available for iOS [here](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/city-trees/id1447048394). (The Android version will be back up on the Play Store soon.)

The app helps you identify trees in your city, using publicly available municipal data and your phone's location.
